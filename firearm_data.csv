Gun Laws vs. Gun Deaths,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"Again and again, commonsense policies prove effective in preventing gun violence. In fact, we’re running out of ways to say the same thing the Gun Law Scorecard shows every year: strong gun laws save lives.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"Many states are listening—Colorado, for example, passed a series of lifesaving laws and raised its grade from a B to an A-. But other states weakened existing gun laws and blocked new ones, and it’s reflected in their levels of gun violence: of the 15 states with the highest gun death rates, 12 received Fs for their gun laws. And these indifferent states don’t put only their own residents at risk. Colorado may have an A-, but it borders five states with Fs.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"We need leaders to accept that gun violence is preventable, that gun safety laws work, and that all our communities deserve to live free of fear. Only then will we finally put an end to this uniquely American epidemic.",,,,,,,

"2023 was a year full of long-awaited wins for gun safety, but it was also marred by horrific mass shootings and the tragic drumbeat of everyday violence. Many states went above and beyond what gun safety advocates thought was possible. Others fell deeper into the gun lobby’s pocket, putting more and more innocent people at risk.",,,,,,,

Innovative Policies,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"Gun violence is a complex, ever-evolving crisis. No one strategy will prevent every type of shooting, but we do know the effective policies and programs that, when deployed in concert, have been proven to reduce gun violence as a whole.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"The gun lobby fights progress at every turn—in statehouses, in the courts, in elections—while also devising workarounds to existing laws in order to turn a profit. To save lives, gun safety advocates have had to adjust their approach, anticipating loopholes and countering extremism. This year states raised their grades in creative and unexpected ways, enacting innovative policies to stop gun violence.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"Despite scandals rocking the gun lobby in recent years and plummeting public support, the industry still makes billions. Bold lawmakers have started hitting gun companies where it hurts—their wallets—while also repealing laws that shield gunmakers from liability and even taxing the gun industry to fund violence intervention programs.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"Technological innovations have accelerated the gun violence crisis as well. Ghost guns, bump stocks, and more are all designed to skirt gun safety laws and make it easier to take lives—but lawmakers are fighting to make these workarounds illegal. At the same time, social media has facilitated a rise in extremism that puts our democracy at risk, compelling legislators in a number of states to take action to prevent armed political violence and intimidation.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"It’s important to remember that policy is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to stopping gun violence. Leaders need to take a holistic approach that features working with the communities most impacted by violence, defending commonsense gun laws in court, and even issuing executive orders. Together, we’ll break gun lobby obstruction and save lives.",,,,,,,

California passed a first-of-its-kind law requiring the gun industry to pay its fair share to curb the gun violence epidemic—a crisis gun companies help fuel. This 11% excise tax on gun manufacturers and sellers (gun buyers are not taxed) will generate nearly $160 million annually to fund proven gun violence prevention programs across the state.,,,,,,,

LIFESAVING NEW LAWS,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"Throughout the year, our experts keep track of the gun laws states are considering—both good and bad—and round up the findings in Gun Law Trendwatch. 2023 saw 103 new positive laws in 25 states, bringing the total enacted since Sandy Hook to over 620.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"We use Sandy Hook as a starting point because the tragedy served as a catalyst for the gun safety movement, motivating advocates and lawmakers alike. When Congress failed to take action following the murder of so many innocent children and teachers, it became clear that states would have to step up. ",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"While gun violence has persisted—dozens of cities are now best known for a mass shooting—these new laws have proven effective. The gun death rates in states that passed significant numbers of gun safety laws following Sandy Hook (such as California, New Jersey, and Washington) are notably lower than in states that weakened their laws or did nothing (such as Idaho, Kentucky, and Missouri).",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"Volume of laws matters because there are so many different forms gun violence takes. A policy that will reduce gun suicide may not necessarily prevent a school shooting, but a different law might. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer to such a massive crisis, but taken together, a collection of targeted solutions can keep people safe.",,,,,,,

Legal Challenges,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"The gun lobby’s strategy to boost profits and dismantle gun regulations isn’t confined to the sway it holds over lawmakers and politicians. Since the Supreme Court’s landmark 2008 decision in DC v. Heller, gun lobby groups have rigorously challenged commonsense, lifesaving gun laws in the courts, seeking to set dangerous new precedents.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"The Supreme Court’s flawed ruling in 2022’s NYSRPA v. Bruen, which weakened standards for carrying loaded weapons in public, further emboldened gun rights extremists. The number of lawsuits challenging local, state, and federal gun laws skyrocketed, with more than double the cases in 2023 than in 2021. Fortunately, judges are upholding gun safety laws in a majority of cases, and GIFFORDS Law Center and other groups are forcefully pushing back in courts across the country.",,,,,,,
